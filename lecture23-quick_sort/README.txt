In quick sort, we first select any random element (usually the first of the subarray we're dealing with). Find the position of a partition element such that, all elements smaller than that lies in its left and all elements greater than that lies in its right. Sort the 2 partitions separately recursively.

Analysis-
Time complexity - O(n*logn)
Space complexity - O(1)
Adaptive - No
Stable - No
Recursive - Yes
