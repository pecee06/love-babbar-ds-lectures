A function which calls itself in its definition is called a recursive function

Why use recursion?
    - Solving a big problem in small chunks

Requirements of recursion
    - Recursive relation
    - Base conditon

* Base condition is required for breaking the recursion, else the function will keep on calling itself till the memory stack is full
