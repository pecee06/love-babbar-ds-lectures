Linked list is a dynamic linear data structure composed of nodes interconnected with eachother

A node broadly consists of 2 sections - data and pointer to another node

Various types of linked list:

* Singly linked list: A node of this type stores one unit of data and address of the node next to it in the sequence. The last node points to NULL

* Doubly linked list: A node of this type stores one unit of data and address of the node next to it and the one before it in the sequence

* Circular linked list: It is a singly linked list with a difference, the last node points to the first node instead of NULL

* Doubly-Circular linked list: It is a doubly linked list with a difference, the last node's next pointer points to the first node and the first node's previous pointer points to last node

Various operations that can be performed:

* Insertion at head/tail
* Insertion at a position
* Deletion at head/tail
* Deletion of a particular node
