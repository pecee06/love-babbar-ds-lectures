Queue is a linear DS that follows First-In-First-Out rule

Following operations can be performed in a queue:
    * enqueue - insert element into queue
    * dequeue - deletes element from queue
    * first - returns first element of queue
    * empty - checks if queue is empty or not

All the above operations are performed in O(1) time
