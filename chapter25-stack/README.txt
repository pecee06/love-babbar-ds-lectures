Stack is a linear DS which follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle for insertion & deletion

We define following operations in a stack-
    * push - inserts an element at top of stack
    * pop - removes topmost element of stack
    * peek - peeks into the stack and returns the topmost element
    * empty - checks whether a stack is empty or not
    * full - checks whether a stack is full or not

Perks:
    * All operations defined on stack are implmented in O(1) time complexity

For implementing static stack we can use array-representation, for dynamic stack we can use linked-representation
