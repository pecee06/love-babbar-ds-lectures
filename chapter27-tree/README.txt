A tree is a hierarchical DS in which we have nodes and its children
A node consists of data and pointers to its child nodes

A node which have no ancestor is a root node
A node which have no descendants is a leaf node

Generally we use binary trees
A binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0, 1 or 2 children
